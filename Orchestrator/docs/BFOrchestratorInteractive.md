
# Interactive

Orchestrator CLI has an "interactive" command which allows a user
to dynamiclly interact with an Orchestrator base lanaguage model and
refine a training utterance set through commandlets.

During an interactive session, the command loads an Orchestrator base model
into memory and manage serveral input cache variables that can be used by
ensuing commandlets. These variables include:

- "current" utterance       - A cache for storing an utterance that can be used by several commandlets
                              for interacting with an Orchestrator model.
- "current" intent labels   - A cache for storing an array of intent labels that can be used by several
                              commandlet for interacting with an Orchestrator model.
- "new" intent labels       - Another cache for storing an array of intent labels, which were mainly
                              used for changing an utterance's intent labels within an Orchestrator model.

Below is the list of the commandlets that can be issued during a 'interactive' session.

    h   - print the help messages with short description of each command

## 'q' - quit command
    q   - quit

## 'd' - display command
    d   - display the utterance, intent label array input caches, Orchestrator config,
          and the label-index map

## 's' - statistics command
    s   - show label-utterance statistics of the model examples

## 'u' - utterance command
    u   - enter a new utterance and save it as the "current" utterance input

## 'cu' - clear utterance variable command
    cu  - clear the "current" utterance input cache

## 'i' - intent variable command
    i   - enter an intent and add it to the "current" intent label array input
          (can be an index for retrieving a label from the label-index map)

## 'ci' - clear intent variable command
    ci  - clear the "current" intent label array input cache

## 'ni' - new intent command
    ni  - enter an intent and add it to the "new" intent label array input
          (can be an index for retrieving a label from the label-index map)

## 'cni' - clear new intent command
    cni - clear the "new" intent label array input cache

## 'f' - find command
    f   - find the "current" utterance if it is already in the model example set

## 'p' - predict command
    p   - make a prediction on the "current" utterance input

## 'v' - validate command
    v   - validate the model and save analyses (validation report) to
          "experiment_predicting_va\orchestrator_predicting_set_summary.html"

## 'vd' - utterance/labels retrieval command (from the Duplicates section of the validation report)
    vd  - reference a validation Duplicates report
          (previously generated by the "v" command) and enter an index
          for retrieving utterance/intents into "current"

## 'va' - utterance/labels retrieval command (from the Ambiguous section of the validation report)
    va  - reference a validation Ambiguous report
          (previously generated by the "v" command) and enter an index
          for retrieving utterance/intents into "current"

## 'vm' - utterance/labels retrieval command (from the Misclassified section of the validation report)
    vm  - reference a validation Misclassified report and enter an index
          (previously generated by the "v" command)
          for retrieving utterance/intents into "current"

## 'vl' - utterance/labels retrieval command (from the Low Confidence section of the validation report)
    vl  - reference a validation LowConfidence report
          (previously generated by the "v" command) and enter an index
          for retrieving utterance/intents into "current"

## 'vat' - ambiguous threshold command
    vat - enter a new validation-report ambiguous closeness threshold

## 'vlt' - low-confidence threshold command
    vlt - enter a new validation-report low-confidence threshold

## 'vmt' - multi-label threshold command
    vmt - enter a new multi-label threshold

## 'vut' - unknown label threshold command
    vut - enter a new unknown-label threshold

## 'vo' - obfuscate command
    vo  - enter a boolean for obfuscating labels/utterances or not in evaluation reports
          generated by the "v" command'

## 'a' - add command
    a   - add the "current" utterance and intent labels to the model example set

## 'r' - remove command
    r   - remove the "current" utterance and intent labels from the model example set

## 'c' - change command
    c   - remove the "current" utterance's intent labels and then
          add it with the "new" intent labels to the model example set

## 'rl' - remove label command
    rl  - remove the "current" intent labels from the model example set

## 'n' - new snapshot command
    n   - create a new snapshot of model examples and save it to
          "experiment_predicting_va\orchestrator_predicting_training_set.blu"
